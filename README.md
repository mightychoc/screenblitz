Screenblitz is an addon to the Hak5 [Screen Crab](https://shop.hak5.org/products/screen-crab), a video man-in-the-middle implant. To gain access to the captured screen recordings, we either need to use the Hak5 Cloud C2 service for remote access or grab the microSD card from the device. Screenblitz now offers a third option: Comfortably access your screen captures by using `blitz` over the Global Socket Relay Network.
